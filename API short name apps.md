Apps on this API have short names, such as "watch_proj" instead of "watch_project". Because Python Linter have a limit to line lengths, saving up as much space as possible could prevent impossible validations.
This document clarify the naming convention:
API app - normal name
watch_proj - watch project
watch_art - watch artist
usr_comm - user comment
project - project
documentation - documentaiton
art_acc - artist account
